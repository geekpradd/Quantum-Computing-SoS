\section{Revised Plan of Action}

So far I have covered the following topics:

Linear algebraic treatment of quantum mechanics, Postulates of Quantum Mechanics, Introduction to Computer Science, Quantum Measurement Theory,  Single Qubit gates, Mixed quantum states, Tensor Products and Partial Traces


The revised plan of action is as follows:

Week 4: Universal Quantum Gates, Superdense coding, Quantum Teleportation

Week 5: Kraus operators, Deutsch Algorithm, Quantum Fourier Transform

Week 6: Quantum Search algorithms: Grover’s algorithm. Shor’s algorithm

Week 7 onwards: Quantum Information Theory

I have mostly been able to stay on my initial plan of action although I could not finish the entirety of chapter 4 which had some topics of Universal Quantum Gates. Thus that topic has been shifted to Week 4.
