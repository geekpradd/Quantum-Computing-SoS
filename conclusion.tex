\chapter{Conclusion}
With this we have come to the end of the report. The report mainly focused on the basics of quantum computation where we began from elementary linear algebra and built our way towards the basics of quantum mechanics, computer science, quantum circuits and eventually made it to some notable quantum algorithms and their applications. The report was in no way exhaustive and it is recommended that readers consult Nielsen and Chuang along the way. It is also essential to note that although we have described everything from a theoretical perspective a lot of work is still going on regarding how to put everything into practice as making hardware that is natively suited for quantum computing has proven to be a challenge. We are hopeful that in the coming years advances in technology will allow the power of quantum computation to come to fruition.
